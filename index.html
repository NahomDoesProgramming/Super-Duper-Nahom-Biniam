    <h1>Hobby</h1>
    <h2>I like to play video games! Super Mario, Sonic The Hedgehog and many others. I like to play video games because they are fun, and I like using electronics. I like playing with my sisters because I can either be nice and let them win or make the sad and beat them brutally. I almost always choose the latter. I also like playing with my dad because he is so bad that he couldn't finish a tutorial. I really like playing video games.</h2>
